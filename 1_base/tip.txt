1. Write script demonstrate
2. Install BATS and asserts
3. Make a simple e2e test
4. Run test - bats script.bast


This is an example of something that is difficult to test

1) We have external dependencies - curl and external service that we need to mock
2) Our code is not really easily testable (by unit tests), we need to refactor first
3) We save response to a file, that is a runtime dependency too
4) We can bats test it, by defintion bats tests are called the same as script but with .bast extension
